<span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in South-Western Ontario, Canada. This region was once home to the town of Ojibway, which became annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Today <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is composed of 5 distinct areas known as: **(i) Black Oak Heritage Park**; **(ii) Ojibway Park**; **(iii) Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**; **(iv) Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **(v) Spring Garden ANSI** (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest). According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is part of the southern most <span id="Blue">ecoregion</span> (i.e. **7E: [Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)**) of Ontario's **Mixed-wood Plains** <span id="Blue">ecozone</span>. Some of the unique features of this region include:  

**(i) GEOLOGY:** The landscape of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> was largely sculpted by glacial ice and water. The unconsolidated material lying atop the bedrock at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> was laid down during the latter part of the [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/) (c. ~75,000 to 10,000 years ago). These layers of ice-age sediment are part of a much larger glacial feature known as the **St. Clair Clay Plain**. The silty-clay content of this plain extends beyond the borders of Essex county into neighbouring Kent and Lambton counties.

**(ii) CLIMATE:** is relatively mild due in large part to the modifying affect of the Great Lakes. 

**(iii) BIODIVERSITY:**

<!-- This theme has a **form-to-email** feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form (`/content/forms/contact.md`). Of course, the example shown below (`your@email.here`) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.

```toml
# please replace with a valid Formspree form id or email address
formspree_form_id: your@email.here
```

Update that file and you're ready to begin receiving submissions. Just submit the active form for the first time, and complete the email address verification step with Formspree, and your contact form is live. The next time someone fills it out, the submission will land in your inbox.

### Multiple Layouts

The files included with the theme have a contact page ready for copy/paste, or you can type `hugo new forms/contact.md` and you're off to the races. There are two layouts for `forms` – `split-right`, and `split-left` – you guessed it, one puts the form on the right and the other on the left. You just fill out the front matter, and the rest is automatic.

```toml
# layout options: split-right or split-left
layout: split-right
```

![Contact Form Split Right Layout Screenshot](built-in-contact-form-screenshot.png)

Both layouts display the page title and description opposite the form, and you can also choose to show your social icon links if you have those configured in the `config.toml` file.
