<span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in South-Western Ontario, Canada. This region was once home to the town of Ojibway, which became annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Today <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is composed of 5 distinct areas known as: **(i) Black Oak Heritage Park**; **(ii) Ojibway Park**; **(iii) Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**; **(iv) Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **(v) Spring Garden ANSI** (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest). According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is part of the southern most <span id="Blue">ecoregion</span> (i.e. **7E: [Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)**) of Ontario's **Mixed-wood Plains** <span id="Blue">ecozone</span>. Some of the unique features of this region include:  

**(i) Glacial Geology:** most of the landforms found in and around <span id="Dred">OPC</span> were created during the latter part of the [Pleistocene](https://stratigraphy.org/chart) (~2.58 million to 11,700 ya) **Ice Age**. The repeated advance and retreat of glaciers (upwards of 2 km thick during the height of this period) mechanically eroded the landscape (i.e. scraping, scouring, and plucking material as it travels). The collection of unconsolidated material (i.e. boulders, rocks, gravel, clay and silt) transported and deposited by the glaciers created a variety of landforms in the province. For example, the most common type of material deposited by the glaciers is called **till** -- a 

deposited at the margins of the glaciers, or along snaking paths of past glacial streams and rivers.  
in the form of hills (e.g. [drumlins](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/gallery/drumlins.html)), low relief plains, or low-to-high rising ridges (e.g. [moraines](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/gallery/moraines.html)). 

**(ii) Mild Climate:** due in large part to the Great Lakes)

**(iii) Rich Biodiversity:** 


resulting melt water also helped shaped the land by creating large plains
