<span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in South-Western Ontario, Canada. This region was once home to the town of Ojibway, which became annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Today <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is composed of 5 distinct areas known as: **(i) Black Oak Heritage Park**; **(ii) Ojibway Park**; **(iii) Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**; **(iv) Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **(v) Spring Garden ANSI** (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest). According to ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is part of the most southern **ecoregion** (i.e. **7E: [Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)**) of Ontario's much larger **Mixed-wood Plains Ecozone**. Some of the unique features of this region include its geology, relatively mild climate (due in large part to the Great Lakes) and its rich biodiversity.
