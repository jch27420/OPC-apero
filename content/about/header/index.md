&nbsp; &nbsp; <span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in Southern Ontario, Canada. It currently consists of 5 neighbouring tracts of land: **(i) Black Oak Heritage Park**; **(ii) Ojibway Park**; **(iii) Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**; **(iv) Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **(v) Spring Garden ANSI** (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest). Although it is part of the traditional territory of the Anishnaabeg people (i.e. **Three Fires Confederacy** of Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Odawa), many other indigenous groups have lived in this area including the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), Attawandaron (Neutral) and Huron (Wyandot). Please consult the **[Ojibway Nature Centre](https://www.ojibway.ca/index.htm)** website for more information about what you can expect to find if you visit there ...it has much to teach us!
