<span id="Dred">O</span>jibway <span id="Dred">P</span>rairie <span id="Dred">C</span>omplex (<span id="Dred">OPC</span>) lies nestled between the city of Windsor and the town of LaSalle in South-Western Ontario, Canada. This region was once home to the town of Ojibway, which became annexed by the city of Windsor in 1966. Today <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is composed of 5 distinct areas known as: **(i) Black Oak Heritage Park**; **(ii) Ojibway Park**; **(iii) Ojibway Prairie Provincial Nature Reserve**; **(iv) Tallgrass Prairie Heritage Park** and **(v) Spring Garden ANSI** (Area of Natural and Scientific Interest). According to Ontario's ecological land classification systems, <span id="Dred">OPC</span> is part of the southern most <span id="Blue">ecoregion</span> (i.e. **7E: [Southern Great Lakes lowland forests](https://www.ontario.ca/page/ecosystems-ontario-part-1-ecozones-and-ecoregions)**) of Ontario's **Mixed-wood Plains** <span id="Blue">ecozone</span>. Some of the unique features of this region include:  

**(i) Geology:** like most parts of province the landscape of <span id="Dred">OPC</span> was sculpted by glacial ice and water. Specifically, ice-age sediment lying atop the bedrock was laid down during the latter part of the [Wisconsin glacial period](https://opentextbc.ca/geology/chapter/16-1-glacial-periods-in-earths-history/), which lasted between ~75,000 to 10,000 years ago. The layers of mostly silty-clay material found at <span id="Dred">OPC</span> are only a small part of a much larger **St. Clair Clay Plain** that extends into neighbouring Kent and Lambton counties.

**(ii) Climate:** due in large part to the Great Lakes)

**(iii) Rich Biodiversity:**
