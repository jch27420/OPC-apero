ALTERNATIVE TACHYON COLOR SCHEME INFO:
=======================================
Step1: Create an "assets" folder in the root of your website project
(don’t add it to your themes/ directory!).
- Create a .scss file in the new assets/ folder.
- Copy the scss code for a full set of color parameters giving
you control over the theme color scheme. For an option like
siteBgColor, for example, you can type one of the predefined
color names from Tachyons and save the file. Use only color
names as shown in the “Color Palette” section of
https://tachyons.io/docs/themes/skins/.

Step 2: back in your config.toml file
Leave the theme blank (so theme = "" with empty quotes)
in your config.toml file.

Step 3: Add the name of your theme file (minus the .scss extension)
that you added to assets/ as the custom_theme.

Your final config.toml would look something like this:
---------------------------------------------------------------
theme = ""
# or, leave theme empty & make your own palette
# see docs at https://hugo-apero.netlify.app/blog/color-themes/
# the custom scss file must be in the assets/ folder
# add the filename name here, without extension
# to use hex colors instead of named tachyons colors, include "hex" in filename
custom_theme = "named-colors"
---------------------------------------------------------------
